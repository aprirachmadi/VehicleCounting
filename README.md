# Vehicle Detection and Counting System using YOLOv8

This project implements a multi-gate vehicle detection system using the YOLOv8 model. The system tracks and counts vehicles as they pass through predefined gates in a video. The project leverages pretrained YOLOv8 weights for object detection and tracking.

Requirements
Before running the project, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

Python 3.8+
ultralytics
supervision
opencv-python
You can install these dependencies using the following command:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Note: Make sure to have a GPU-enabled machine for better performance, as YOLOv8 is computationally intensive.

How to Run
1. Clone the Repository
Clone this repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/vehicle_detection_project.git
cd vehicle_detection_project
2. Place Your Input Video
Place the input video file (.mp4 format) into the data/ directory. The default name expected is input_video.mp4. If your file has a different name, you will need to modify the script accordingly.

3. Run the Python Script
Execute the vehicle detection script:

bash
Copy code
python src/vehicle_detection.py
This script will process the video and generate an output video with vehicle detections and gate crossing counts. The output video will be saved in the output/ directory as output_multi_gate_vehicle_detection.mp4.

4. Review the Output
After the script finishes running, you can find the processed video in the output/ directory. The video will display the vehicles detected and annotated with the gates they have crossed.

Customization
Adjusting Gate Coordinates
If you need to change the gate positions, you can modify the coordinates in the vehicle_detection.py script:

python
Copy code
START_1, END_1 = sv.Point(10, 135), sv.Point(87, 151)
# ...
Changing the Input Video Path
If your video file is in a different location or has a different name, update the video_path variable in the vehicle_detection.py script:

python
Copy code
video_path = "data/your_video_name.mp4"
